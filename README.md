## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) installed as a development dependency

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/node-js-jest-unit-tests.git
   cd node-js-jest-unit-tests
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Install Jest (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```
## Running Tests
To run all tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
## Conclusion

With Jest, you can ensure that your Node.js application functions as expected by writing reliable unit tests. This setup provides the foundation to test and develop robust applications in a streamlined and efficient way.
